# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
~~~
items=[153,147,124,102]
print(sum(items))
~~~

## Output
![446131752-6fc78cda-88a2-4888-8afe-aee8fba47903](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1411adc-e797-437a-b980-dac875eea678)

## Result
